# Featured Pages

When setting pages as featured, you specify a 'Featured Date' when editing your page.
This date will be used to sort or display the pages when used in your templates.

If you no longer want a page to be featured you may:

* clear the Featured Date and save the page
* set the Featured Date to a date outside the range you will display
* set the page status to Hidden
